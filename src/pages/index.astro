                Welcome to KIOSK Headroom, a place to recreate the physical space of KIOSK. We have missed you. Come talk to us and others about KIOSK, the
                weather, what you ate last night, etc. Free-form and flowing conversation just like the old days in the shop. When it's green we are open. When
                it's red we are closed. We are not always here, but we will be as much as possible. If you see us, please say hello.

                Needless to say, this is a work in progress, a beta experience. Stuff will break. Be sure to turn on your camera so we can see you and you can
                see us. Why is a good question. The answer is simple, we miss the shop and talking to all of you.

                If no-one is around, try messaging Marco on +1 917 945 2978 and ask us to pop in. We'll be right there. Unless we can't. Once this is up and
                running we plan to have regular hours, just like the New York store.
